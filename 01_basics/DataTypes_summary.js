// Primitive Data Types (Call by value)

/* 
   Whenever we copy the value from one place to other we dont get the original value, we work with 
   the copied value.

   7 types: String, Number, Boolean, null(empty), undefined, Symbol, BigInt
*/



// Non-Primitive Data Types (reference type)

/*
    In memory the reference is allocated directly.

    Array, Objects, Functions

*/



/*
    JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that the type of a variable is interpreted at 
    runtime, and you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable when you define it. 
    Variables in JavaScript can hold values of any type, and the type of a variable can change during 
    the execution of the program.
